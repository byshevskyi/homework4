				The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) 
				began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 
				had not been updated since 2000,[7] and the World Wide Web 
				Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. 
				In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to 
				expire and decided not to renew it. W3C and WHATWG are currently 
				working together on the development of HTML5.[8]
				While some features of HTML5 are often compared to Adobe Flash, the two 
				technologies are very different. Both include features for playing audio and 
				video within web pages, and for using Scalable Vector Graphics. However, HTML5 
				on its own cannot be used for animation or interactivity – it must be supplemented 
				with CSS3 or JavaScript. There are many Flash capabilities that have no direct 
				counterpart in HTML5. See Comparison of HTML5 and Flash.
				Although HTML5 has been well known among web developers for years, its interactive 
				capabilities became a topic of mainstream media around April 2010[9][10][11][12] 
				after Apple Inc's then-CEO Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled "Thoughts on 
				Flash" where he concluded that "Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or 
				consume any kind of web content" and that "new open standards created in the mobile 
				era, such as HTML5, will win".[13] This sparked a debate in web development circles 
				suggesting that, while HTML5 provides enhanced functionality, developers must 
				consider the varying browser support of the different parts of the standard as 
				well as other functionality differences between HTML5 and Flash.[14] In early 
				November 2011, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development of Flash for 
				mobile devices and reorient its efforts in developing tools using HTML5.[15]
